Python bindings for the
[H3 Core Library](https://github.com/uber/h3).

For API reference, please see the
[H3 Documentation](https://h3geo.org/).

**New since v3.6.1**: We upload pre-built
[Python Wheels to PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/h3) for Linux/Mac/Windows,
which should avoid many previous installation issues.


## Installation

From [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/h3/):

`pip install h3`

From [conda](https://github.com/conda-forge/h3-py-feedstock):

```sh
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install h3-py
```

## Usage

```python
>>> import h3
>>> lat, lng = 0, 0
>>> resolution = 0
>>> h3.geo_to_h3(lat, lng, resolution)
'8075fffffffffff'
```

## Example gallery

Browse [a collection of example notebooks](https://github.com/uber/h3-py-notebooks),
and if you have examples or visualizations of your own, please feel free to contribute!

We also have a simple [walkthrough of the API](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/uber/h3-py-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/usage.ipynb).
For more information, please see the [H3 Documentation](https://h3geo.org/).


## APIs

We provide multiple APIs in `h3-py`.
All APIs have the same set of functions, but differ
in their input/output formats.

### `h3.api.basic_str`

H3 indexes are represented as Python `str`s, using `list` and `set` for collections.

This is the default API provided when you `import h3`.
That is, `import h3.api.basic_str as h3` and `import h3`
are basically equivalent.

```python
>>> import h3
>>> h = h3.geo_to_h3(0, 0, 0)
>>> h
'8075fffffffffff'

>>> h3.hex_ring(h, 1)
{'8055fffffffffff',
 '8059fffffffffff',
 '807dfffffffffff',
 '8083fffffffffff',
 '8099fffffffffff'}
```

### `h3.api.basic_int`

H3 indexes are represented as Python `int`s, using `list` and `set` for collections.

```python
>>> import h3.api.basic_int as h3
>>> h = h3.geo_to_h3(0, 0, 0)
>>> h
578536630256664575

>>> h3.hex_ring(h, 1)
{577973680303243263,
 578044049047420927,
 578677367745019903,
 578782920861286399,
 579169948954263551}
```

### `h3.api.numpy_int`

H3 indexes are represented as `uint64`s, using `numpy.ndarray`
for collections.

The intention is for this API to be faster and more memory-efficient by
not requiring `int` to `str` conversion and by using
no-copy `numpy` arrays instead of Python `list`s and `set`s.

```python
>>> import h3.api.numpy_int as h3
>>> h = h3.geo_to_h3(0, 0, 0)
>>> h
578536630256664575

>>> h3.hex_ring(h, 1)
array([578782920861286399, 578044049047420927, 577973680303243263,
       578677367745019903, 579169948954263551], dtype=uint64)
```

Note that `h3` has no runtime dependencies on other libraries, so a standard
`pip install` will install no additional libraries.
However, `h3.api.numpy_int` requires `numpy`. To have `numpy` installed (if it isn't already) along
with `h3`, run `pip install h3[numpy]`.


### `h3.api.memview_int`

H3 indexes are represented as `uint64`s, using Python
[`memoryview` objects](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview)
for collections.

This API has the same benefits as `numpy_int`, except it uses
(the less well-known but dependency-free) `memoryview`.

```python
>>> import h3.api.memview_int as h3
>>> h = h3.geo_to_h3(0, 0, 0)
>>> h
578536630256664575

>>> mv = h3.hex_ring(h, 1)
>>> mv
<MemoryView of 'array' at 0x11188c710>

>>> mv[0]
578782920861286399

>>> list(mv)
[578782920861286399,
 578044049047420927,
 577973680303243263,
 578677367745019903,
 579169948954263551]
```

When using this API with `numpy`, note that `numpy.array` **creates a copy**
of the data, while `numpy.asarray` **does not create a copy** and the
result points to the same memory location as the `memoryview` object.

Continuing from the example above,

```python
>>> mv = h3.hex_ring(h, 1)
>>> a = np.array(mv)
>>> mv[0] = 0
>>> a
array([578782920861286399, 578044049047420927, 577973680303243263,
       578677367745019903, 579169948954263551], dtype=uint64)

>>> mv = h3.hex_ring(h, 1)
>>> a = np.asarray(mv)
>>> mv[0] = 0
>>> a
array([                 0, 578044049047420927, 577973680303243263,
       578677367745019903, 579169948954263551], dtype=uint64)
```

## Versioning

`h3-py` wraps the [H3 Core Library](https://github.com/uber/h3),
which is written in C.
Both projects employ [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/),
with versions taking the form `X.Y.Z`.

`h3-py` will match the C library
in *major* and *minor* numbers (`X.Y`), but may be different on the
*patch* (`Z`) number.

Use `h3.versions()` to see the version numbers for both
`h3-py` and the C library. For example,

```python
>>> import h3
>>> h3.versions()
{'c': '3.6.3', 'python': '3.6.1'}
```
