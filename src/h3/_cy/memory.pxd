## things i'm not happy about with this current situation

- abolish any appearance of &thing[0]. (i.e., identical interfaces)
- can i make the interface for all these memory views identical?
- also, what's going on with the segfault stuff when we `.to_mv()` before checking an error? why isn't it robust to that?
